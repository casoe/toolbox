# Now setup ssh so that it doesn’t ask for password when you perform ssh. 
# Use ssh-keygen on local server to generate public and private keys.
ssh-keygen

# Note: When it asks you to enter the passphrase just press enter key, and do not give any password here.

# Use ssh-copy-id, to copy the public key to the remote host.
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub osmc@192.168.2.38

# It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
chmod 0700 .ssh && chmod 0600 .ssh/*

# Note: The above will ask the password for your account on the remote host, 
# and copy the public key automatically to the appropriate location. If ssh-copy-id 
# doesn’t work for you, use the method we discussed earlier to setup ssh password less login.

# Now, you should be able to ssh to remote host without entering the password.
ssh osmc@192.168.2.38

# rsync should work the very same way
rsync -avz /home/pi/backup/ osmc@192.168.2.38:/mnt/hd2tb/other/backup/hades
