# growpart is part of the cloud-utils-package, and should be available in your distro's repositories, in case its not already installed with your OS. Debian or Ubuntu:
apt-get install -y cloud-utils

# To make the kernel aware, one can issue the following command as root:
echo 1 > /sys/class/block/sda/device/rescan

# Vorhandene Partitionen anzeigen
fdisk -l

# Partition vergrößern (1 ist die Nummer der Partition)
growpart /dev/sda 1

# The partition is resized now and the kernel is already using the new partition table. The last missing piece is the file system. Since we use an ext4 file system  
# this is a one-liner as well, that can even run on a mounted file system:
resize2fs /dev/sda1
